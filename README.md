# Object-oriented C++

## Assignment

1. Design proper abstraction (interfaces)
2. Apply inheritance
3. Fix encapsulation
4. Use polymorphism to represent every type of car, using a single pointer
5. Fix a diamond problem
6. Fix potential memory leaks
7. Think about the way of keeping engines in cars. Should they be kept by a value, reference or a pointer (what kind of pointer)?
8. Is this code testable?

## Post-work

You can work in groups or individually. Please fork the repo and submit a Pull Request after you have finished.

1. Create `InvalidGear` exception. It should be thrown when someone tries eg. change a gear from 5 to R. It should inherit from one of STL exceptions
2. Fix interfaces to be easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly (like `accelerate(-999)`)
3. (Optional) Write proper unit tests to this code.
4. Read one of below articles. It will be useful for the next lesson.
